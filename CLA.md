# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Civil BIM Viewer — Individual Contributor License Agreement v1.0

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Civil BIM Viewer project ("Project"). To clarify the intellectual property rights granted with contributions, we require every contributor to sign this Contributor License Agreement ("Agreement").

By signing this Agreement (via the CLA Assistant bot on your first Pull Request), you accept and agree to the following terms and conditions for your present and future contributions submitted to the Project.

---

### 1. Definitions

**"You" (or "Your")** means the individual who submits a Contribution to the Project.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in the Project. "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project maintainers, including pull requests, issues, patches, emails, and messages on project communication channels.

**"Project"** means the Civil BIM Viewer software and related documentation maintained at the Project's official repository.

### 2. Grant of Copyright License

You hereby grant to the Project maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to:

- Reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.
- Sublicense the above rights through multiple tiers of sublicensees, including under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license **and** under a separate commercial license offered by the Project.

### 3. Grant of Patent License

You hereby grant to the Project maintainers and to recipients of software distributed by the Project a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer Your Contributions, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contributions alone or by combination of Your Contributions with the Project to which such Contributions were submitted.

### 4. Representations

You represent that:

- **(a)** You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make the Contributions on behalf of that employer, or that your employer has waived such rights.
- **(b)** Each of Your Contributions is Your original creation. If any part of Your Contribution is not Your original creation, You will clearly identify the source and any license or other restriction of which You are personally aware.
- **(c)** Your Contribution does not violate any third-party rights (copyright, patent, trade secret, or other intellectual property rights).

### 5. No Obligation

You understand that the decision to include Your Contribution in any product or release is at the sole discretion of the Project maintainers.

### 6. Support / Warranty Disclaimer

Your Contributions are provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied. You are not expected to provide support for Your Contributions except to the extent You desire to do so.

### 7. Dual-Licensing Context

You understand that the Project currently distributes code under the **AGPL-3.0-or-later** license and may additionally offer a **commercial license** for organizations that cannot comply with the AGPL. The sublicensing rights in Section 2 enable this dual-licensing model. Revenue from commercial licenses, if any, will be used to sustain Project development.
